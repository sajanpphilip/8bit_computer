# 8bit_computer
This is a Bread Board Implementation of the Project actually carried out by Ben Eater (www.eater.net) in the name 8 bit Computer from scratch. This project is still in development phase. Project is carried out using the Components available in India.

As of now the Following Modules are finished. 
* Registers
* Arithmetic and Logic Unit
* Clock

As most of the LS ICs are not available in India at present, the only option is to go with HC ICs. In that case, it is required to limit the current through the LEDs by attaching 1 k Ohm resistors to the Cathode. We have cut the Cathode and attached the Resistors directly into the Cathode.

The Implementation related document of the Clock Module is available [here](https://github.com/sajanpphilip/8bit_computer/blob/main/555%20TIMER%20CLOCK.pdf).

The Video demonstrating the working of Clock Module is available [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/nsGtpWCRCGnqSC5t9)
